// Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game.
//  Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow',
//   or 'red'.
// • Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is,
//  print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
// • Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. 
// (The version that fails will have no output.)
//  define variable
var alienColor = "White";
