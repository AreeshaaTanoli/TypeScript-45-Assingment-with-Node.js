// Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace
//  characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use
//   each character combination, "\t" and "\t, at least once. Print the name once,
//    so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.

let whiteSpace=" \n\t Arreesha Tanoli \t\n "
